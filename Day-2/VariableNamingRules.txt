Variable Naming Rules

Start with a Letter or Underscore:
=================================
     Variable names must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_). They cannot start with a number.

Example:
=======
num_1 = 10
_num = 20

#invalid
1num = 40

Case Sensitivity:
================= 
    Variable names are case-sensitive. 
    This means var, Var, and VAR are considered different variables.

Example:
========
var = 10
Var = 20
VAR = 30

No Reserved Keywords: Variable names cannot be the same as Python's reserved keywords (e.g., False, class, return, try, True, None, etc.).

Example:
========

class = 10  # Invalid
return = 20  # Invalid

No Explicit Declaration Needed: 
==============================

In Python, variables are created when they are first assigned a value. 
You do not need to declare their type explicitly. 

Examples:
=======
x = 10      # Integer
y = "Hello" # String
z = 3.14    # Float

Dynamic Typing: 
=============
Python is dynamically typed, which means you can change the type of a variable by assigning a new value of a different type. 

x = 10      # x is an integer
x = "Hello" # Now x is a string
