Indentation:
===========
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

if 5 > 2 : 
print("five is greater than two")

If we execute above blok of code it will throw error, there should be indentation before print statement.

if 5 > 2 :
    print("five is greater than two")

The above code is correct, it will print the output

if 5 > 2 :
    print("five is greater than two")
        print("Five")

The above code is not valid, the indentation should be same for every line if above line give 4 spaces
for indentation, the next lines inside that block should give same amount of spaces.



if 5 > 2 :
    print("five is greater than two")
if 2 < 7 : 
        print("Two is less than seven")

The above code is valid, because both print statements are independent, the spaces or indentation is our choice.
