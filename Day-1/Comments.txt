Single line comments:
=====================
# is used to indicate that the comment is single line
# This is a single line comment.


Multi line comments:
===================
# is used for multiple lines to indicate multi line comments.

Second approach for multi line comments:
=======================================

Using string literals

"""
  comments 
  comments
  comments
"""

the above lines won't execute in code, so it is treated as multi line comments.
