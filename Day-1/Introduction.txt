Python:
=======
Python is a popular programming language.
Python is a pocedure oriented programming language, object oriented programming language, 
scripting language, and functional programming language.

Difference between Python and Java
==================================

                Python                                                       Java
Python has generally fewer lines of code.                         Java has long lines of code.

Django and Flask are the popluar frameworks.                     Spring, SpringBoot, Hibernate, Servlete etc are frameworks.

The syntax is easy to remember almost similar                    The syntax is complex as it throws errors if you miss semicolons or curly braces.
to human language.

Python is slower since it uses an interpreter                    Java is faster in speed as compared to python.
and also determines the data type at run time.



Difference between Scripting language and programming language:
==============================================================



Scripting Languages:

    Typically interpreted, meaning the code is executed line-by-line at runtime by an interpreter.
    Examples include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.
    Allows for quick testing and iteration of code.
    Often used for automating tasks, writing small programs, or adding functionality to other software.
    Common in web development, system administration, and rapid prototyping.
    Examples: JavaScript for client-side web scripting, Python for automation scripts.



Programming Languages:

    Generally compiled, meaning the code is translated into machine code by a compiler before execution.
    Examples include C, C++, and Java.
    The compiled code is usually optimized for performance.
    Used for building large-scale applications, system software, and performance-critical tasks.
    Suitable for creating standalone applications and complex systems.
    Examples: C++ for game development, Java for enterprise applications.


Python is used for:

web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.
